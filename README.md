I made a mini operating system (if you call it that) for the Arduino nano (it might also work for other Arduino boards). This is my first project, so enjoy:3
Before installation, you must have an OLED screen and the adafruit_GFX and adafruit_SSD1306 libraries. For comfortable use, you must have 5 buttons: D2 - upper left D3 - upper right D4 - lower left D5 - lower right D6 - button. Okay, if there are any shortcomings, then forgive me, after all, I'm a newbie and I don't think this is a system.
